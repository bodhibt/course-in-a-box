title: Ecstatic Poetry as a Visionary Art
description: What if your longings were actually windows into your essence? The lens of ecstatic poetry provides a method for us to open to our longings, to contact the soft spots in our lives, and to engage with them in ways that can expose their hidden sacredness. Ecstatic poetry is, at its heart, a journey into the Divine within, a way of contacting our essence. This course will offer participants an opportunity to experience poetry writing as a spiritual practice. By utilizing practices such as meditation and yoga, time in nature, contemplation, and more, participants will be invited to share in the poetic styles inspired by early writers like Rumi and Hafiz. Concepts will be introduced such as ecstatic theory and poetry practice, writing techniques, and creative expression, as we join together in the power of our essences. Writers of all levels are welcome.
